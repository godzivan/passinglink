## Passing Link

Passing Link is an implementation of a PS4-compatible USB input device on the inexpensive STM32F103
microcontroller, for which entire Blue Pill development boards can be purchased for under $2 shipped.

Currently, support for all inputs except for touchpad gestures and gyro have been implemented. PS4
authentication is supported, if you dump the keys from a licensed PS4 controller.

### Getting started

#### Acquiring hardware
You'll need two pieces of equipment: the actual development board, and an ST-LINK programmer
with which to flash firmware.

Blue Pills can be purchased from various sources, but be aware that some sources (*especially*
resellers on Amazon) come with an incorrect resistor value that can break USB.

I've had success with [this seller on AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32649400326.html) for a vanilla
Blue Pill, and RobotDyn, which sells a very high quality variant ([$8 with Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077SRGL47),
[$2.99 shipped from China](https://robotdyn.com/stm32f103-stm32-arm-mini-system-dev-board-stm-firmware.html),
or [$4.59 with 128kB of flash](https://robotdyn.com/stm32f103cbt6-128-kb-flash-stm32-arm-mini-system-dev-board-5d4f1f17-d44f-11e7-b464-10c37b90f38d.html)).

The firmware image doesn't fit in 64kB when compiled in debug mode, and they're dirt cheap, so
ordering a 128kB version from RobotDyn is probably a good idea.

The ST-LINK bundle from the AliExpress seller above works fine, and so does [this one on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01J7N3RE6),
if you'd rather not wait 3 weeks for it to arrive from China.

#### Building and flashing firmware

The following instructions probably work on a recent Ubuntu:

Initial setup:
```
sudo apt-get install openocd gdb-multiarch
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- --default-toolchain nightly
source ~/.cargo.env
rustup target add thumbv7m-none-eabi
```

Building an image:
```
cargo -Z config-profile build --release
```

Flashing an image:
```
openocd -f openocd.cfg                   # once, in another terminal
cargo -Z config-profile run --release
```

Debugging:
```
openocd -f openocd.cfg                   # once, in another terminal
gdb-multiarch -q -x openocd.gdb target/thumbv7m-none-eabi/release/passinglink

# Serial output on pin A2, at 921600 baud 8n1
```

#### Pinout

Starting from the top right of the board, going counter-clockwise:
